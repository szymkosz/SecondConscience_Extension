# SecondConscience
## Inspiration
Kids are beginning to join social media networks at very young ages. According to I-SAFE foundation, around half of the adolescents on these sites are victims of cyber bullying. Cyber bullying can have many negative effects on children, including low self esteem and the feeling of isolation.
## What it does
We decided to create software that can be integrated with current social media platforms to help with the current cyber bullying issue. The software will ask a user if they are sure they want to post a message if the message sentiment correlates with common cyber bullying statements. The software will also notify a user when they are tagged in post that contains cyber bullying sentiment and immediately prompts them to either report the message/user or ignore the message. This will not only protect the victim of a cyber bullying attack by providing an immediate line of defense, but also acts as a second conscience for the bully and give them the opportunity to reevaluate their actions.
## How we built it
We worked as a team to create a browser extension implementing our software. We also used the Microsoft's Azure API for Language Understanding Intelligence Service (LUIS) and Microsoft's Text Analytics API in cognitive services for sentiment analysis.
